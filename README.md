# CommunityCurator-BackEnd


# Requirements
- [Python 3.X](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [PgAdmin4](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/)

# Package Installation
- Create your [virtual enviornment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) and activate it
       - Best practice is to name this `env` or `venv` as it will be ignored from verion control
- Install necessary packages and libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
       - This will automatically install libraries such as Django and PostgreSQL without having to search for it

## Development Push/Merge Instructions
Adding/changing code
 - Create a separate branch for working
        git branch <branch-name>
 - Add in your code and make edits in your branch
 - Maintain your branch with regular pulls from master
        git pull
 - When edits are final and code is working, merge master into your branch
 - Ensure everything is working
 - Verify with the team that a pull from your branch works on their end
 - Merge to main
        git merge <alias>/<branch>
